Web Fuzzing

Fuzzing: a testing technique that sends various types of user input to a certain interface to study how it would react.

SQL injection: send random special characters and see how server reacts
Buffer overflow: send long strings and increment their length and see if binary breaks

Wordlists: /opt/useful/SecLists

locate directory-list-2.3-small.txt

If the wordlist has copyright comments, use '-ic' flag to get rid of these lines in ffuf.
