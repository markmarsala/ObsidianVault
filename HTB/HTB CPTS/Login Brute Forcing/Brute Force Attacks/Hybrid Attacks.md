Hybrid Attacks work by predicting human behavior and using a targeted wordlist.

For instance, if a user has the password Summer2023, and must change it, then they will most likely change it to Summer2024 or Summer2023!

What to put into wordlists
- Common Passwords
- Industry-specific terms
- Password Change Policy
- Personal info
- Initial reconnaissance

Given this policy:
- Minimum of 8 characters
- At least on uppercase letter
- At least one number
