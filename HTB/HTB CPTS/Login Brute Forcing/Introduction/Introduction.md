Factors affecting success of bruteforce:
- Complexity of password
- Computational power available to the attacker
- Security measures in place

Types of bruteforcing:
- Simple Brute Force
- Dictionary Attack
- Hybrid Attack
  - Appending or prepending characters to dictionary words 
- Credential Stuffing
  - Use leaked credentials and check for password reuse
- Password Spraying
- Rainbow Table Attack
  - Pre-computed hashes to passwords 
- Reverse Brute Force
  - particular password is being resued across multiple accounts
- Distributed Brute Force
  - Distribute work across multiple computers
 
Brute forcing is employed when:
- Other avenues are exhausted
- Password policies are weak
- Specific accounts are targeted
