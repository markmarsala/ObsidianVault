Setting a baseline
- DNS records, network device backups, and DHCP configurations
- Full and current application inventory
- A list of all enterprise hosts and their location
- Users who have elevated permissions
- A list of any dual-homed hosts (More than one network interface)
- Keeping a visual network diagram of your environment

#### People
Educate PEOPLE

BYOD are risky

- Multi-factor authentication
- SOC as a service
- Incident response plan


#### Policies
- Disaster recovery plan
- Proper policies and procedures for asset monitoring and management
	- Host audits, the use of asset tags, and periodic asset inventories can help ensure hosts are not lost
- Access control policies (user account provisioning/de-provisioning), multi-factor authentication mechanisms
- Processes for provisioning and decommissioning hosts (i.e., baseline security hardening guideline, gold images)
- Change management processes to formally document who did what and when they did it

Perimeter first
- `What exactly are we protecting?`
- `What are the most valuable assets the organization owns that need securing?`
- `What can be considered the perimeter of our network?`
- `What devices & services can be accessed from the Internet? (Public-facing)`
- `How can we detect & prevent when an attacker is attempting an attack?`
- `How can we make sure the right person &/or team receives alerts as soon as something isn't right?`
- `Who on our team is responsible for monitoring alerts and any actions our technical controls flag as potentially malicious?`
- `Do we have any external trusts with outside partners?`
- `What types of authentication mechanisms are we using?`
- `Do we require Out-of-Band (OOB) management for our infrastructure. If so, who has access permissions?`
- `Do we have a Disaster Recovery plan?`


- External interface on a firewall
    - Next-Gen Firewall Capabilities
        - Blocking suspicious connections by IP
        - Ensuring only approved individuals are connecting to VPNs
        - Building the ability to quick disconnect suspicious connections without disrupting business functions

Internal considerations
- `Are any hosts that require exposure to the internet properly hardened and placed in a DMZ network?`
- `Are we using Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems within our environment?`
- `How are our networks configured? Are different teams confined to their own network segments?`
- `Do we have separate networks for production and management networks?`
- `How are we tracking approved employees who have remote access to admin/management networks?`
- `How are we correlating the data we are receiving from our infrastructure defenses and end-points?`
- `Are we utilizing host-based IDS, IPS, and event logs?`
