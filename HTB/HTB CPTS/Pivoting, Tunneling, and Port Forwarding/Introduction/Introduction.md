First things first:
- Check privilege level
- Network connections
- Potential VPN or other remote access software

Pivoting: moving to other networks through a compromised host to find more targets on different network segments.

- Pivot Host
- Proxy
- Foothold
- Beach Head system
- Jump Host



Lateral movement vs. pivoting and tunneling

Lateral movement: a technique to further our access to additional hosts, application, and services within a network environment. Spread wide within a network, elevating our privileges.

Pivoting: utilizing multiple hosts to cross network boundaries you would not usually have access to. Allows us to delve deeper into the network accessing previously unreachable environments.

Tunneling: using various protocols to shuttle traffic in/out of a network where there is a chance of our traffic being detected.
