A computer can have multiple NICs (physical and virtual), meaning it can have multiple IP addresses assigned, allowing it to communicate on various networks.

**ifconfig** - macOS and Linux
**ipconfig** - windows


tun0 - tunnel interface indicates a VPN connection is active
eth0 - publicly routable IP address (ISPs will route traffic)
