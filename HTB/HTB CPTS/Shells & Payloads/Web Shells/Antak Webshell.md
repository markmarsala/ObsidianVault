#### ASPX

Active Server Page Extended is a file type/extension written for Microsoft's ASP.NET Framework. On a web server running the ASP.NET framework, web form pages can be generated for users to input data. On the server side, the information will be converted into HTML. We can take advantage of this by using an ASPX-based web shell to control the underlying Windows operating system. Let's witness this first-hand by utilizing the Antak Webshell.

#### Antak Webshell

- Powershell

```shell-session
ls /usr/share/nishang/Antak-WebShell
```
