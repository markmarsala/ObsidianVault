#### Security Assessments

Find and confirm vulnerabilities are present so we can work to patch, mitigate, or remove them.


#### Vulnerability Assessments

Based on a particular security standard, and compliance with these standards is analyzed (checklist).


#### Penetration Tests

Simulated cyber attack in which pen testers legally conduct actions that a threat actor may perform to see if certain kinds of exploits are possible.

- Black Box: no prior knowledge of network or applications
- Grey Box: little bit of knowledge of the network
- White Box: full access (source code, configs)

- Evasive
- Non-evasive
	- Nessus network vulnerability scanner
- Hybrid evasive

Types of pentesters
- Application (web, API, mobile)
- Network (networking, Windows, Linux, Active Directory, 1+ programming language)
- Physical
- Social Engineering

Pentests are appropriate for medium or high security maturity level. This includes having well-executed cyber incident response plans, computer security incident response team, chief information security officer, a chief technical officer, security testing over the years, and strong security culture.


##### Vulnerability Assessments vs Penetration Tests

Vulnerability assessment: checklist using a standard (GDPR compliance, OWASP web application security standards)

Penetration test: simulated cyber attack

Security audits: assessed from a third party to ensure compliance.

Bug bounty programs

Red team assessments: dedicated black box testing. Typically have an end goal and only report the vulnerabilities that led to the completion of the goal.

Purple team: both red and blue team
