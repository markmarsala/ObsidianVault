Methodology

1. Conduct Risk Identification and Analysis
2. Develop Vulnerability Scanning Policies
3. Identify the Type of Scans
4. Configure the Scan
5. Perform the Scan
6. Evaluate and Consider Possible Risks
7. Interpret the Scan Results
8. Create a Remediation & Mitigation Plan

Threat + vulnerability = risk

Threat: a new incident with potential to harm a system.

Exploit: any code or resources that can be used to take advantage of an asset's weakness.

Risk: possibility of assets or data being harmed or destroyed by threat actors.

Asset management
Asset Inventory: information technology, operational technology, physical, software, mobile, and development assets.

Data assets:
- All data stored on-premises. HDDs and SSDs in endpoints (PCs and mobile devices), HDDs & SSDs in servers, external drives in the local network, optical media (DVDs, Blu-ray discs, CDs), flash media (USB sticks, SD cards). Legacy technology may include floppy disks, ZIP drives (a relic from the 1990s), and tape drives.
    
- All of the data storage that their cloud provider possesses. [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (`AWS`), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (`GCP`), and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) are some of the most popular cloud providers, but there are many more. Sometimes corporate networks are "multi-cloud," meaning they have more than one cloud provider. A company's cloud provider will provide tools that can be used to inventory all of the data stored by that particular cloud provider.
    
- All data stored within various `Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)` applications. This data is also "in the cloud" but might not all be within the scope of a corporate cloud provider account. These are often consumer services or the "business" version of those services. Think of online services such as `Google Drive`, `Dropbox`, `Microsoft Teams`, `Apple iCloud`, `Adobe Creative Suite`, `Microsoft Office 365`, `Google Docs`, and the list goes on.
    
- All of the applications a company needs to use to conduct their usual operation and business. Including applications that are deployed locally and applications that are deployed through the cloud or are otherwise Software-as-a-Service.
    
- All of a company's on-premises computer networking devices. These include but aren't limited to `routers`, `firewalls`, `hubs`, `switches`, dedicated `intrusion detection` and `prevention systems` (`IDS/IPS`), `data loss prevention` (`DLP`) systems, and so on.
