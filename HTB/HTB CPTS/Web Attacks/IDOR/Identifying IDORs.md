**URL Parameters & APIs

Look in:
- URL
- API
- Cookies
- HTTP Headers

**AJAX Calls
Identify unused parameters, or APIs in the front-end code in the form of JavaScript AJAX calls.

If we do not have an admin account, only the user-level functions would be used, while admin functions would be disabled.
We may still be able to find the admin functions if we look into the front-end JavaScript code and may be able o identify AJAX calls to specific end-points or APIs that contain direct object references.


**Hashing/Encoding

Instead of using sequential numbers as object references, it may be encoded or hashes instead.


**Other users

For more complex attack, use two different users and check which API calls each have to gain details on what we can access as another user without the same privileges.
