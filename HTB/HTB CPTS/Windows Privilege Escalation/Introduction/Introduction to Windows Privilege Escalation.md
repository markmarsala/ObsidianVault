Escalate privileges for one of the following reasons:
- Testing a client's gold image Windows workstation and server build for flaws
- To escalate privileges locally to gain access to some local resource such as a database
- To gain NT AUTHORITY/System level access on a domain-joined machine to gain a foothold into the client's AD environment
- To obtain credentials to move laterally or escalate privileges within the client's network

Techniques:
- Abusing Windows group privileges
- Bypassing User Account Control
- Leveraging unpatched kernel exploits
- Traffic Capture
- Abusing Windows user privileges
- Abusing weak service/file permissions
- Credential theft
