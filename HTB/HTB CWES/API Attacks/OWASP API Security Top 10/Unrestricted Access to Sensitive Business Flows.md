An API endpoint is vulnerable to Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows if it exposes a sensitive business flow without appropriately restricting access to it (knowing when discounts are in effect).

If the endpoint repsonsible for purchasing products does not implement rate-limiting, (unrestricted resource consumption), then we can purchase all the stock at the discounted price and resell at original price.
