1. Login with a valid account
2. Inspect request
3. It shows the location to be /admin.php?user_id=183
4. Delete user_id to reveal it returns us to index.php login, thus it has to do with authentication
5. We can bypass authentication by accessing the URL /admin.php?user_id=183 directly.
6. We can brute-force the administrator ID.
