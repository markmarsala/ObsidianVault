## Session Fixation

When a new token isn't generated after successful authentication.

Attacker can send a user a link, like http://example.com/?sid=123456.
When user signs in, the cookie is set to the sid, and since this doesn't change, the attacker can log in with that cookie to their account.


## Improper Session Timeout
If not set, the session is indefinite.
