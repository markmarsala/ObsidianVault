Reflected XSS: Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after processing (e.g., search result or error message).
Stored XSS: Occurs when user input is stored in the back end database and then displayed upon retrieval (e.g., posts or comments).
DOM XSS: Occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is written to an HTML DOM object (e.g., vulnerable username or page title).
```js
#"><img src=/ onerror=alert(document.cookie)>
```
